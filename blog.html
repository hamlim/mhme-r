				<h1 id="ideas">On Ideas</h1>
				<p>I think it is always important to have a small notebook by my side no matter where I go. For the most part I use it to take small notes, like my laundry will be done at 2:30 pm. Or to remember small things happening during my day. But on the off chance that I come up with some random idea, I generally will write down some of the initial musings behind the idea there. I use a small Cahier(spelling?) notebook made by Moleskine. It works well. After I do some musings, and I have a finalized idea in mind I quickly go to a Google Doc titled Ideas, and add the new idea to the list of bullet points. For the most part, after a month or so without any actual development on any of these ideas I realize that some of them already exist, or some of them just aren't worth developing because of their minimal reach. However for the most part, I don't do any work on them because I find products so close to the idea that I don't worry about developing it further. Ideas, when they sit for too long without more though, lose their value.</p>
				<h1 id="working-as-a-college-student">Define Web Dev. Work</h1>
				<p>As a college student I spend most of my time doing stuff associated with school work. unfortunately this work for the most part does not keep me excited, only a few courses here at RPI and at my high school actually kept my interest in the work that we have covered, or the projects I did. So the question that I ask myself almost once a week is, how do I do what I want to do for the rest of my life, while also doing school work? This is normally an easy problem to solve if you actually make money from what you do. However, the only true job I have had was doing refuse removal at a fair over summer, to be precise it was only 14 days. So I keep doing what I want to do, developing things in my off time on things that I want to see/use each day. I can try to surmise this paragraph, but it is already short enough I feel.</p>

				<hr>

				<h1 id="snapchat">Snapchat</h1>
				<p>Snapchat is an amazing service, and I want to point out first before I continue that the idea I will lay out below originated before the release of the new features in the application. A few weeks ago I was on a snapchat run, communicating almost entirely with my friends with Snapchat. We routinely used Facebook messenger to communicate but now snapchat had become the norm to text friends. There was one clear feature that was missing in the experience however, and that feature still does not exist in today&#39;s application. This feature is the idea of groups. In almost any sort of web application that is intended as a social network there needs to be the idea/generalization of a group or team. It is simply natural to include a grouping function in a social network simply because that is what we do in real life, we group together to communicate. I still feel that this feature would make Snapchat even more friendly to people that still use services like Facebook messenger and others.</p>
				<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>
				<p>When I began re-working my personal web page several weeks ago now, I had a pretty weak workflow that was broken up by unspecified amounts of time spent doing things that weren&#39;t work. I would continuously go to youtube to watch a few videos and other sites to try to get some news or whatever. I would then spend about 90% of my time on these other tasks and barely get any work done. The central problem was the lack of any well worked to do list. And I find that even to this day that to do lists must be the center or heart of a good workflow for anyone. </p><p>So I have been using <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> to handle all my to do lists, and as I tackle many projects at once it has proven to be quite a good task managing software to use, If you don&#39;t use it now, I highly suggest you give it a try. I also started using <a href="http://draftin.com">Draft</a> as a default writing platform. it has some of the best markdown support I have found anywhere from using my code editors to using other services Draft is the one I keep coming back to. So that has been a little bit about my workflow, the next thing I want to talk/write about is notifications.</p>
				<h1 id="notifications">Notifications</h1>
				<p>With the recent news about Android wear and the Moto 360 as well as the LG G watch I wanted to discuss what I feel is the most important thing to tackle in the next few months for any developer, and I plan on putting it on the horizon to try to develop a unique solution to. The problem people should be focusing in on is creating a single cross-platform actionable syncing notification hub. Some other services provide minimal implementations of this idea in many products but they seem to always lack any actionable tasks. I think the next big thing is that web app developers will see a fewer amount of user visits and a larger amount of API calls. This is great for many reasons, and there really is only one way to prevent that from happening, which is to design a platform people will love. Ultimately I think it can be a good thing to develop an app that simply congregates all your notifications in one simple spot. I also plan on blogging about this a bit more in the future.</p>

				<p class="uk-article-meta">Written at 2:09 am EST Thursday March 13th by Matt Hamlin</p>
				<p class="uk-article-lead">Some more ideas about sharing, trends with searches and the next big thing for startups.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Throughout the week I have been working on my next big project, I have the first few steps completed, yet true to many other pieces about developing startups the product I am developing does not scale at all yet. One of the troubles of using twitter to develop big data trends is that the limitations of the twitter API prevents any large amount of data being read into an application. This development has been eye opening to me to realize just how much data is being requested by each user for an application of this size. I will work on developing a better backend for the site once I have finished with some of my silly school work.</p>
				<p>The next thing I want to discuss/write about is the problem that my friends and I have encountered multiple times with classic search engines. Search engines like Google and Bing store data in ways that computers can understand but humans have to learn a lot in order to properly intake the information. The next thing humans tend to go to after Google doesn't return information they want is to turn to their friends either through social networks or in person to ask questions. I feel that startups like Quora are only the beginnning of the new age of search engines. Also I want to remind everyone that back in the early 2000's or so there was a startup called Qwiki if I remember correctly that wanted to solve the problem the other way around by translating what Google would provide in a search result into something that would be easier for humans to read and intake. I find it so interesting that two different groups of visionaries can see the same problem and attempt to tackle it differently.</p>
				<p>Finally the last thing I wanted to quickly comment upon was the trend of curration in startups.I believe there are four levels of curration in any startup scene, the first of which is aggregation, the second is curation provided by friends, the third is curration through the form of a team of content editors, and finally the fourth element of curration is using computer algorithms and things like "Big Data" to help currate information and resources for users. These are the 4 levels of curration, as of now I can't comeent on which is the best form of curration and which isn't, but I can say that what Facebook does is a mash up of the fourth version and the second version of curration. For Facebook paper, the company has a team of content editors that fill the content in from their own resources. I think that whatever comes in the near future that is as  big as Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare will have to take a stance for what type of curration they believe to be the one that will take us into the future.</p>

				<h1 class="uk-article-title">Blog Post 2!</h1>
				<p class="uk-article-meta">Written initially at 4:07 pm EST Monday March 3rd  by myself</p>
				<p class="uk-article-lead">Some updates since the first post, and some things on content generation problems with my #yoloswag project, and some ideas on humor classification and possible ideas on future projects.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>So some updates since my first blog post, it has only been 4 or so days, and since then I have been to every class that I had scheduled, I did some exercise with Will on Saturday and Sunday had no one show up to the practice for the soccer team except for myself, my co-captain Will and our friend Spencer. I think I need to realize that since this is an introductory season for our soccer team, that we will not have enough people that are truly willing to play soccer, because they enjoy it as a sport. I think these two next months will be fairly hard and stressful as a team manager and captain.</p>
				<p>So onto the next part I wanted to discuss was about content curation and generation. For those who read this #yoloswag is a small project I recently launched located <a href="projects.campuslist.myrpi.org/cazz/">here</a> that has a simple hashtag describing some set of content for the day. I personally do all the content curation and editing for the site, it is all run by me essentially, no special code to change it every day, just some man hours put into curating and editing the site. I have been grasping at what content to update the site with each day, and I have personally set up a timeline for which I need to find some content to put up on the site, I realize that the site probably only sees about 30 visitors a week, and that I probably provide those 25 visits. So it can be understandable to slow down and only post content every week, or every other day, and not every day. To find interesting yet new content to present is one of the hardest jobs I have been presented with. It offers a new challenge to solve, maybe Content strategists are better fit for the job than I am.</p>
				<p>Finally I wanted to comment on the difference between humor with context and without. My friend and I were recently playing some Battlefield 4 and it kind of hit me on the head that sometimes we laugh about things that are specifically lacking in their context, I find stories as a whole are sometimes deeper without context because it allows the reader or listener to fill in the context themselves.</p>

				<h1 class="uk-article-title">My Blog</h1>
				<p class="uk-article-meta">Written initially at 11:40 pm EST Friday February 28th by myself</p>
				<p class="uk-article-lead">New webpage, new content, new me. Today I officially launched my personal webpage which is currently lacking in a ton of content that I hope to finish it with soon. I realized today that I wanted to start expanding the work that I do to learn more and develop more.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Over the next few months I plan on posting all the little hacks, projects, ideas and works in progress to this blog and to the projects section in the home page. I realized yesterday that college is often said to be the choice of two of the following three options: Social life, great grades, and personal projects. I thought about it over-night and thought to myself that there is no reason for college to be filled with work that wasn't helping my overall goal. This does not mean that I plan to not do the work that I don't think helps me learn or do amazing things, but that I will develop my personal projects within the constructs of class assignments. </p>
				<p>This is an initial post, one of many I have made in the past on many different blogging platforms, and on many different occasions, I can sort through multiple pages in both of my notebooks and find pages worth of the exact same thing that is written here, so I will spare the reader in saying that I plan on making this the last one that is needed.</p>
				<p>The first step was using a TODO application to keep track of the things I must do. I have tried a majority of them in the past, even trying to use Github issue tracker for todos, but the easiest way that works for me is writing it in two places: my personal notebook and on my own developed in-house todo web application.</p>
				<p>The second step is devoting my wasted time in watching Youtube videos, and other distractions into doing homework. I should never be doing something that does not attempt to fulfill any one of the three items in my list of college actions to follow.</p>
				<p>I also expect that blogging here on my own platform will make me a better writer and spell checker. Anyway that is my plan for the next few months, if you stumbled upon this blog post and have since read it, I apologize for wasting your time on something that is meant to be more of a personal guidebook on how to work.</p>
