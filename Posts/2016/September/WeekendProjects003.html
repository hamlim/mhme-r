                    This weekend was absically 80% spent working on projects. Saturday I re-configured my personal website (this one!) to have all my styling be done in PostCSS. Previously I was using Sass compiled to css, but figured that I wanted to get back to writing what will be the future of css. I am a bit upset that PostCSS compiles my 'future' css into css that is made for browsers in the early 2000's, it just isn't progressive enhancement.

                    I am however also considering moving my website over into a React-based website. I know that it will significantly slow down my website beacause I won't be server-rendering the React at all, however I think I will implement it as a behind the scenes variant of my website. My goal then would be to have a few different versions of my site, one beign the current version that is really quick to load on any device, one that is all React based, and maybe a third that uses web components for everything.
                </p>

                    I also started yet another project, this time building on top of my <a href="https://goexploring.today/boilerplate" class="link link--out">boilerplate</a> project that is a React, Redux, React Router, and PostCSS based, all using Webpack for the building of the assets.
