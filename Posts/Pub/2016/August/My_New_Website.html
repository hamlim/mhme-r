                    Over the past 2 or three weeks I have been both busy at work and also busy outside of work. Most of my work that I have been doing outside of work has been devoted to this website. I originally made this website in (apparently) October of 2015, and since then I have redesigned the site only about 5 or 6 times, each time fully re-hauling the entire infrastructure and design language. These past two or three weeks have been spent building out an infrastructure that will hopefully be a bit easier to manage. I still will do a ton of things manually, however I generally prefer to touch the code myself more often than not ðŸ˜ƒ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to write out everything that I have done, and also talk a bit about the code that I am using to build this site. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t know that much about web development you can still read along most of this post will be really low level stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to start this off with a brief timeline of all the visual changes I have made to my site. Unfortunately the css for the site snapshots on the Wayback machine doesnâ€™t seem to load (either that or it didnâ€™t collect the css). In fact I can only find one version of the site that has working css at all and unfortunately this version also rendered part of the site via JS so that doesnâ€™t show up either<sup><a href="#fn1" class="link">1</a></sup>. The version that I can find is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160111084107/http://matthamlin.me/" class="link link--out">here</a>. I had just found out about <a href="//getskeleton.com" class="link link--out">skeletoncss</a> and wanted to put it to use in my own website. I loved this version of my site, it was clean and also a bit colorful. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current version of the site, shown below in case it changes in the future, is broken down into basically 4 page types as it is now. The first is the <a href="#image1" class="link">home page</a> the second is <a href="#image2" class="link">my resume</a>, the third is my <a href="#image3" class="link">blog archive</a>, and the fourth is the layout of a <a href="#image4" class="link">blog post</a>.
