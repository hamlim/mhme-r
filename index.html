						<p>When Is Better is a term project, turn full time development project with a group of fantastic individuals from a course at RPI. We wanted to develop a web app that would handle the hard work with setting up team meetings. We always thought that scheduling team meetings are one sided so we decided to change that. As I said at the beginning of the paragraph, many of this stuff will be changing soon, so expect developments on twitter or in my blog! </p>
