						<h4>Experiments in Human Nature</h4>
						<p>This site is dedicated to showing off some of the work I have done on the web and also for representing my Resume and some of the content in my Blog. Everything here is made by me, yet through the use of a lot of technologies developed by others. Feel free to look through my work and my thoughts!</p>

						<h2>#YOLOSWAG</h2>
						<h4>Experiments in Media</h4>
						<p><a href="http://projects.campuslist.myrpi.org/cazz" target="_blank">#YOLOSWAG</a> became a way for me to express the things I enjoyed watching/hearing around the internet in the previous days or so. It offered me a way to express some interesting link, in the form of a hashtag, to all my friends. </p>

						<h2>Currentwire</h2>
						<h4>Tackling the News</h4>
						<p><a href="http://n.myrpi.org" target="_blank">Currentwire</a> was one of my culminating experiences with the Twitter API in full scale and although I did not get the growth of the site as I expected or wanted, I did learn about many limitations in the API and things about Javascript that I did not know of before. I still sometimes go to Curratd to look up some trending news tweets, and was highly interested in opportunities of developing a pay to use version.</p>
                        <p>Although I don't think it is officailly done, I am confident that what I have developed so far makes Currentwire a successful product.</p>

						<h2>When is Better</h2>
						<h4>Experiments in Team Time Management</h4>
						<p>When Is Better is a term project, turn full time development project with a group of fantastic individuals from a course at RPI. We wanted to develop a web app that would handle the hard work with setting up team meetings. We always thought that scheduling team meetings are one sided so we decided to change that. As I said at the beginning of the paragraph, many of this stuff will be changing soon, so expect developments on twitter or in my blog! </p>
